    <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
    <p><a href= "https://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a> stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is a standard markup language for websites. Anything you see on a web page such as text, pictures, or other features appears on the browser side due to HTML. It essentially commands the browser on how to display information along with the format.</p>

    <h4>What is CSS?</h4>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS</a>, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to stylize the HTML elements on a webpage. You can customize the font, colors, layout, and image sizes with the help of CSS.</p>
